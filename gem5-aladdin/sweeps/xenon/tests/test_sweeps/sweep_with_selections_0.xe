# This sweep tests whether sweeps for a selection of objects produce the
# correct values when there is a sweep on the same parameter for a larger
# scope. That is:
#
# `sweep unrolling for * from 1 to 4 expstep` should be applied to all loops
# except for those under aes_aes.aes256_encrypt_ecb, which have their own sweep
# commands and come after the sweep on *.
